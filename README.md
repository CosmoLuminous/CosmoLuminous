## Hi there..!!! 

<![Profile Visits:](https://visitor-badge.glitch.me/badge?page_id=cosmoluminous)>

I am Aman Bhardwaj, a PhD student :man_student: at [IIT-Delhi](https://home.iitd.ac.in/) focusing on the development of Healthcare AI systems that cater to the unique challenges of resource constrained settings in developing nations. I am currently being advised by  [Prof. Dr. Rahul Garg](https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~rahulgarg/) and [Prof. Srikanta Bedathur](https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~srikanta/) (CSE, IIT-Delhi), and [Dr. Vishnu VY](https://www.aiims.edu/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=7878&catid=193&lang=en) (Neurology, AIIMS-New Delhi). 

Recently, I successfully completed my MS (Research) from SIT, [IIT-Delhi](https://home.iitd.ac.in/), where I worked closely with Prof. Rahul Garg on early identification of Brain Strokes and classification of its types in resource limited environments. Additionally, I have made significant contributions by developing a generic sparse factor model using an unsupervised approach, enabling a deeper understanding of observed variables of the data in terms of a fewer number of latent factors.

My educational background includes a B.Tech. degree in Electronics and Communications Engineering from the National Institute of Technology, Hamirpur (H.P).

### Research Areas Include
* AI for Healthcare / Digital Health. (Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Computer Vision).
* Multivariate Sparse Factor Modeling.
* Time Series Modeling and Representation Learning.

Feel free to mail me if you wish to collaborate with me on project. I am open to all sorts of opportunities. ðŸ˜€
