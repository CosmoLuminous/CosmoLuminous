<br />

I am Aman Bhardwaj, a Doctoral Researcher at [IIT-Delhi](https://home.iitd.ac.in/) at School of Information Technology. 
:man_student: Iâ€™m currently working on some interesting research problems in the field of Healthcare AI under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Rahul Garg](https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~rahulgarg/), Computer Science & Engineering Department, [IIT-Delhi](https://home.iitd.ac.in/).

My MS (Research) thesis at SIT, IIT-Delhi is based on early identification of Brain Stroke and classification of its types in resource limited environment of developing nations. Additionally, I've worked on developing a generic sparse factor model via an unsupervised approach to understand the behaviour of observed variables of the data in terms of a fewer numbers of latent factors.

### Research Areas Include
* Affordable Healthcare AI Systems for Developing Countries. (:atom: Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Computer Vision).
* Multivariate Sparse Factor Modeling.
* Human Pose Estimation.

Feel free to mail me if you wish to collaborate with me on project. I am open to all sorts of opportunities. ðŸ˜€
